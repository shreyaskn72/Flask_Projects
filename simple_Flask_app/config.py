"""
Note that this config file is very simplified and would not be appropriate for a more
complex application. For bigger applications, you may choose to have different config.py
files for testing, development, and production, and put them in a config directory, making
use of classes and inheritance. You may have some variables that should not be publicly
shared, such as passwords and secret keys. These can be put in an instance/config.py file,
which should not be pushed to version control.
